	<p>EnduroDogs are the only hotdog based running fuel on the market. Scientists know science, so we left 'em to it and gathered a team of radical runners, big winners, and dog hounds to cram as much awesome as possible into one marathon of flavor. Our Pro Doggies have engineered a foot-long food-tube that'll push you beyond your boundaries of taste AND performance.</p>
